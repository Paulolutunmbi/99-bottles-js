# 99 Bottles of Beer (DOM Version)

A simple JavaScript project that dynamically generates the lyrics of the "99 Bottles of Beer" song in the browser.

## What this project demonstrates
- Loops and conditionals in JavaScript
- DOM manipulation
- Handling singular and plural word logic

## Technologies used
- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6)

## How it works
The script selects a container element from the DOM, then loops from 99 down to 1.  
For each number, it generates the correct lyric lines and adjusts the word “bottle” based on the number.  
All output is rendered dynamically on the page using JavaScript.

## Purpose
This project was built as a practice exercise to strengthen JavaScript logic, control flow, and DOM manipulation skills.
